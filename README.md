🚀 Excited to Share My Power BI Journey! 📊

I recently took a deep dive into Power BI and created my very first set of interactive dashboards — and I’m thrilled with the outcome!

These dashboards showcase:
✅ Monthly, quarterly, and yearly sales trends
✅ City-wise and model-wise performance
✅ Customer ratings and payment method insights
✅ Comparative analytics with previous years

💡 I learned how to transform raw data into clear, visual insights — and it’s amazing how powerful storytelling becomes with data visualization!

Swipe through the dashboards below ⬇️ and feel free to share your feedback or tips to improve further. Learning never stops! 💪
